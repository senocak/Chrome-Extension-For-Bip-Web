## üöÄ The Open-Source Approach to Digital Privacy

This isn't just another closed-source privacy tool. Built entirely in the open, this extension showcases best practices in modern Chrome extension development while solving real-world privacy challenges. Every line of code, every architectural decision, and every feature implementation is available for the community to learn from, contribute to, and improve upon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Code Deep-Dive
### **React-Powered Popup Interface with TypeScript**
The extension's popup interface demonstrates sophisticated React patterns with full TypeScript support:
```typescript
const Popup: () => React.JSX.Element = (): React.JSX.Element => {
    const [currentTab, setCurrentTab] = useState<chrome.tabs.Tab |null>(null)
    const { t } = useTranslation()

    const defaultSettings: Settings = {
        on: true,
        styles: {
            messages: false,
            messagesPreview: false,
            mediaPreview: false,
            name: false,
            profilePic: false,
            textInput: false,
        },
        varStyles: {
            msBlur: 8,    // Message blur intensity
            mspBlur: 8,   // Message preview blur
            mdgBlur: 20,  // Media blur (high privacy)
            mdpBlur: 20,  // Media preview blur
            nmBlur: 5,    // Name blur (subtle)
            ppBlur: 8,    // Profile picture blur
            wiBlur: 14,   // Text input blur
        }
    }
    
    const [settings, setSettings] = useChromeStorageLocal('settings', defaultSettings)
    
    // Dynamic badge calculation - shows active privacy layers
    const enabledStylesCount: string = useMemo((): string => {
        if (!settings?.styles) return "X"
        return Object.values(settings.styles).filter(Boolean).length.toString()
    }, [settings])
}
```

### **Dynamic CSS Injection System**
The heart of the privacy system lies in its intelligent CSS generation. The extension dynamically creates CSS rules based on user preferences:
```typescript
export const getCSS = (settings: Partial<Settings>): CSSStyles => {
  const defaultBlur = {
    msBlur: 8, mspBlur: 8, mdgBlur: 20, mdpBlur: 20, 
    nmBlur: 5, ppBlur: 8, wiBlur: 14,
  }
  
  const varStyles = settings.varStyles || defaultBlur
  
  return {
    messages: `
      /* Targeted selectors for Bip Web's dynamic class names */
      div[itemtype="messages"] div[class^="_textBubble__card_info__message_container_"], 
      div[itemtype="messages"] div[class^="_textBubble__card_info__message_content_text_"], 
      div[itemtype="messages"] div[class^="video-element"], 
      div[itemtype="messages"] div[class^="document-element"], 
      div[itemtype="messages"] div[class^="image-element"] {
        filter: blur(${varStyles.msBlur}px) !important;
        transition: filter 0.3s ease-in-out !important;
      }
      
      /* Smart hover reveal functionality */
      div[itemtype="messages"]:hover div[class^="_textBubble__card_info__message_container_"] {
        filter: none !important;
      }
    `,
    // ... additional CSS rules for other privacy layers
  }
}
```

### **Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Implementation**
The extension showcases modern Chrome extension architecture with Manifest V3:
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Bip Web Privacy Extension",
  "description": "Privacy extension for web.bip.com that applies blur effects to various elements",
  "version": "1.1",
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
    "js": ["js/vendor.js", "js/content_script.js", "content.js"]
  }],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "js/background.js"
  },
  "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab", "storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]
}
```
